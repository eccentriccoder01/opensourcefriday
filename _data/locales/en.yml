      message: 'Once you are a maintainer on a project that others rely on, open source transitions from "sharing the code" to "sharing the maintenance." As we all know, "maintenance" takes time, which is most effectively spent in a continuous block to ensure you can finish, e.g., code review before you start to lose context.'
